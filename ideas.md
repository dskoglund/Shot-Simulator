1. My project is a "shot-simulator" for an "NBA stats enthusiast" who wants to simulate an individual shot or multiple shots from an NBA player of their choice at a certain location on the court.
  a. User can select a current NBA player and view the players advanced shooting stats based on court location.(stats pulled from an NBA stats api)
  b. User can simulate a shot by clicking a button (eventually a location on the court model).
  c. User can visualize a shot log for the shot  simulations they have run.
  d. User can simulate multiple shots without clicking the court model.
  e. User can play a 30 second 3 pt shooting game to try to get the high score. (user can visualize other high scores.)


#1 - User can simulate a shot by clicking a button (eventually a location on the court model).

#2 - User can visualize a shot log for the shot simulations they have run.

#3 - User can select a current NBA player and view the players advanced shooting stats based on court location.(stats pulled from an NBA stats api)
